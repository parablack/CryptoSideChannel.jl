The code in the files aes-code-original.jl and aesgf-code-original.jl in this directory is not my own work.
It has been taken from https://github.com/faf0/AES.jl/ at commit 92ea00536a7280c710f9dfa755e6ea3747b1b7aa.

This code has been adapted to work with the CryptoSideChannel.jl framework.
 The adapted version can be found in aes-code.jl and aesgf-code.jl, respectively.

The applied diff can be found in appendix A of my dissertation.
